      <h1>Skills & Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years ago,
        I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
        collaborated with talented people to create web products for both
        business and consumer use. I create successful responsive websites that
        are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main area of
        my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and
        medium web apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding
        interactive layouts. I also have full-stack developer experience with
        popular open-source CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js
        and others). Visit my <strong>Linkedin profile</strong> for more details
        or just contact me.
